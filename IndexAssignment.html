<h2>More About Me</h2>

<details>
	<summary>My Childhood</summary>
	<p> I grew up in a small city in a different country, where I spent a lot of my time reading and playing with toys, often on my own. I used to love dinosaurs so much I built my own model at scale, divided into Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and recently, I was reminded of that love. 

I also liked books about the universe, wild animals and fiction tales in general. </p>
